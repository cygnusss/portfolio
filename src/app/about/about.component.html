  <div class="about_me">
    Avid world traveler who is ready to give up a year worth of Friday-night parties for a night in the nature under the sky full of stars, and everything that I’ve ever had to see the Orion nebula from a distance of 6 light years. When free from work I learn languages, I believe you speak to a human’s heart when you speak their mother tongue.
